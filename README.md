## Project description
***
 The aim of this study is to replicate human motion using a robotic platform equipped with a depth camera, image processing techniques, and inverse kinematics. The objectives include obtaining transform (tf) data of a person through Microsoft Kinect and the openni application program interface (API), performing kinematic calculations to convert tf tracking data into usable information for the Baxter robot, and assigning the appropriate data to the corresponding joints of the Baxter robot to achieve accurate mimicking actions.
